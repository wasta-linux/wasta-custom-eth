This extension prevents LibreOffice from refactoring MS Excel VBA macros into Basic.  This ensures the macros will run unmodified by LibreOffice, which is essential if the macro needs to continue to work in MS Excel.  The unmodifed VBA macro must be tested to ensure LibreOffice compatibility.  Any changes to the VBA code need to be done in MS Excel.  LibreOffice will be able to run the unmodified VBA macro but will not be able to save any changes to its code.
